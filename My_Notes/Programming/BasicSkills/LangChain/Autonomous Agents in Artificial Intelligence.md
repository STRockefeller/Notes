### Summary:
Autonomous agents are AI-driven systems capable of performing tasks or making decisions independently without requiring constant human intervention. These agents are designed to operate within a specific environment or framework, using data and predefined rules or machine learning algorithms to make decisions, execute actions, and adjust their behavior. Autonomous agents are employed in a wide variety of applications, including robotics, software bots, and intelligent assistants, where they interact with their surroundings, make real-time decisions, and adapt to new situations.

The main goal of autonomous agents is to mimic human-like problem-solving capabilities, allowing them to achieve specific objectives while responding to environmental stimuli. These agents can be enhanced with long-term memory, enabling them to recall previous experiences, make informed decisions, and optimize future actions. In frameworks like LangChain, autonomous agents can also integrate with language models, leveraging natural language understanding for more complex tasks and decision-making.
