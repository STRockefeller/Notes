## definition
  
> LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by large language models (LLMs).

[ref](https://python.langchain.com/docs/introduction/)

> LangChain is an open source framework for building applications based on large language models (LLMs). LLMs are large deep-learning models pre-trained on large amounts of data that can generate responses to user queriesâ€”for example, answering questions or creating images from text-based prompts.

> It's designed to simplify the process of creating applications that use LLMs, like chatbots and virtual assistants

| **LangChain**         | A framework for developing applications that integrate with language models.                                                                     | AI applications, [[NLP]], language models, memory                                                         |
| **Chains**            | A sequence of steps in LangChain that connects language models to tools or data, allowing for structured workflows.                              | Workflows, pipelines, integration                                                                         |
| **Prompt Templates**  | Reusable templates that standardize input to the language model, helping to shape model behavior.                                                | Custom prompts, input, model behavior                                                                     |
| **Memory Management** | A feature that allows the model to remember context or past interactions across sessions.                                                        | [[Long-term Memory in Artificial Intelligence\|Long-term memory]], session, context                       |
| **Agents**            | Autonomous entities built using LangChain that can make decisions, perform actions, or interact with APIs based on their language understanding. | [[Autonomous Agents in Artificial Intelligence\|Autonomous agents]], AI decision-making, tool integration |
| **Tool Usage**        | Integration of external tools like APIs, databases, or functions into the language model's decision process.                                     | API calls, databases, external tools                                                                      |
| **Integration**       | Connecting language models to external systems such as databases, documents, or APIs to enrich model responses and actions.                      | API integration, databases, external resources                                                            |

### Glossary:

- **[[NLP]] (Natural Language Processing)**: A field of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language.
- **[[Autonomous Agents in Artificial Intelligence|Autonomous Agent]]**: A system that performs tasks without direct human intervention, often based on language understanding and decision-making.
- **Memory**: In the context of LangChain, it refers to the system's ability to remember past interactions or context to improve future responses.
