### Summary:
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. It involves a combination of linguistics, computer science, and machine learning to allow machines to process and analyze vast amounts of natural language data. NLP is applied in a wide range of tasks, such as language translation, sentiment analysis, text summarization, and chatbots. The field has made significant advancements due to deep learning models like Transformers, which power systems such as GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) and BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers).

NLP plays a crucial role in applications that involve human-computer interaction, enabling machines to understand the nuances of language, including grammar, tone, and context. It is a rapidly growing field with applications in areas like customer support automation, healthcare (through language-based diagnosis), and voice-activated assistants.
